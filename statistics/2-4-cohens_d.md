CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)

The Cohen's d for the total weight of the babies (in pounds) between the group of first babies vs. others is -0.088672927072602006.

The difference of the total weight of the babies between the two groups is larger than the difference of pregnancy lengths. There is more of an effect on the weight of the babies than the pregnancy lengths when comparing the two groups.
